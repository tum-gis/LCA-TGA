# Life Cycle Assessment of Technical Building Services of Large Residential Building Stocks Using Semantic 3D City Models

This repository contains the visualisation of the studies result, presented and published at the [3D GeoInfo 2020 conference](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/3dgeoinfo/), in the [3D City Database Web-Map-Client (3D web client)](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-web-map/). The here as example presented results refer to the specific primary energy demand [kWh/m<sup>2</sup>*a] for the use stage of all 115,306 residential buildings in Munich. Thus, all color-coded buildings are residential buildings and all non-colored, non-residential buildings. The coloring is done using the color scheme on the energy-related evaluation band of the German energy certificates, according to EnEV (see following figure).
